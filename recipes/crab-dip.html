        <p>Great crab dip for game day. It even works nicely with the cheap canned crab you find next to the tuna fish and chopped clams. If a hot shellfish dip isn’t your thing, pretty much any chopped up protein will do just fine. By the way, if times are really tough, you don’t have to add anything. </p>
